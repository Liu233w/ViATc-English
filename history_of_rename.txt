This file contains all filenames that were renamed by pressing r wheather it was fancy or regular rename
You can disable this history completely in the settings.
ViATc doesn't save filenames renamed by double-click, shift+F6 nor multi-rename.
For the multi-rename, TC has its own built-in "Undo" option that can restore last multi-rename.
