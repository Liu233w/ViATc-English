The viatc.ini file should be located in your Total Commander directory.
You can add and remove shortcuts directly in ini file or via ViATc Settings window.
Lines that begin with a semicolon ; are ignored. It's a standard comment in ini files.

If you have mapped CapsLock as Escape in other AHK script you need to map it again in viatc.ini
<CapsLock>=<Esc>
