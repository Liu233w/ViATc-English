Usage:
=====
1. Easy way using executable:  
- Download ViATc https://github.com/magicstep/ViATc-English/archive/master.zip, extract, go into "viatc-0.5.3" folder, extract executable.zip and run the exe file that is there
- Notice: I promise that this exe is clean, but compiled AHK scripts trigger antiviruses so you might have to add an exception.
- Look for a new icon in the tray, right-click on it and choose Help.

2. AHK script way:  
- Download and install Autohotkey, it is easy to learn but powerful. https://autohotkey.com/
- Download ViATc https://github.com/magicstep/ViATc-English/archive/master.zip, extract, go into "viatc-0.5.3" folder and double-click viatc-0.5.3en.ahk
- Look for a new icon in the tray, right-click on it and choose Help.

Version 0.6 is not finished and most likely never will be. Please use 0.5
